### Hi there 👋
こんにちわ 안녕

This is Po, I'm just graduated from Kennesaw State University, GA, U.S this year.

My major is Computer Science.
I usually play around with C++ python.

Few years ago, I was a model maker with Maya, but that was a long story.

I love coding, typing, learning language, Anime and FPS Gaming.

Hope one day I can speak many language around the world.

Hope u Enjoy ur life. Peace!!
